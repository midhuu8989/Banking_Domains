A **normal finance app** is reactive. It waits for user input and responds accordingly. For example:

- You manually enter expenses to track spending.
- You request investment advice.
- You simulate a loan by inputting your values.

üí° **Example:**
> You input ‚Çπ50,000 monthly income ‚Üí App shows savings suggestions.

st.markdown("### ü§ñ Agentic Personal Finance Advisor:")
st.markdown("""
An **agentic AI** behaves more like an assistant:
- It understands your financial patterns without you asking.
- It proactively gives advice (e.g., "Cut down food delivery spending").
- It simulates outcomes and sends alerts (e.g., "Your EMI is due tomorrow").

üí° **Example:**
> ‚ÄúYou spent ‚Çπ12,000 on food delivery this month. Consider switching to home-cooked meals to save ‚Çπ5,000.‚Äù

‚ú® **Agentic AI = Intent + Autonomy + Proactiveness**
